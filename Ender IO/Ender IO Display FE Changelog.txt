Version 1.2:
-Rearanged versions.  Base Ender IO now has a purple power bar texture (that I made).  The text only file is now the default, and the red bar was moved to the additional files section.
-Added comments to the en_us.lang file to indicate if the entries come from Ender IO Base or Ender IO Machines.
-Gave each pack its own pack.png image.
-Removed version numbers from the file names.  Any future updates should not have to re-enable the resource pack.

Version 1.1:
-Corrected two ÂµI references in the machines subsection.
-Fixed description on the 'red bar only' pack.

Version 1.0:
-Initial Creation
